# Pacman_AI
The game of pacman, a [berckley project](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html)<br>
## Short Project Descriptions ##
[Project_0](http://ai.berkeley.edu/tutorial.html)<br>
This short UNIX/Python tutorial introduces students to the Python programming language and the UNIX environment.<br>
[Project_1](http://ai.berkeley.edu/search.html)<br>
Implementation of depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.<br>
[Project_2](http://ai.berkeley.edu/multiagent.html)<br>
Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. Implementation of multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.<br>
